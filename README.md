# rust-bevy-tutorial

This is my first entry into game-dev with Rust. I chose Bevy as the game engine/framework.

I also thought about using GGEZ but it seems that Bevy might win the popular vote in a few months.


The tutorial is sadly, really short. So I will continue the learning by following up with: https://mbuffett.com/posts/bevy-snake-tutorial/  which is titles `Creating a Snake Clone in Rust, with Bevy`

I will save it under rust-bevy-snake-tutorial
